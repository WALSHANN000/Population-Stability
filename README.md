This is a final project I did for my Math Modeling class.
For this project, I used the Lotka-Voltera equation to model competing plant and prey populations.
I then changed the number of predators in the system to see how the stability of plant and prey populations changed.
I coded in Python to create population and population growth rate graphs.
I also created a presentation and write up.
